print("As he clocked in for his shift, he started up the engine and began his route on to downtown Woodward.")
    print("He knew he'd have to stop at Mack, Adelaide, and Montcalm; each stop having to be extra alert because of all he'd seen on his routes Uptown.")
    print("To help his nights go by, he'd always give the people funny nicknames; something to keep him laughing and awake")
print("There was Quarter head Stan, Rena Red, and Two headed Sam because he had a knot the size of a small head on the side of his neck.")
print(" \(trainRide(train:.Mack) ?? "I am gangster") needed to get off.")

print("The train got queit and before you knew it, everyone on the train statrted laughing.")
print("It's true' he yelled as he stomped off the train. ")
print("Even though \(person1) laughed along with the crowd, he put serious thought into what he had just heard.")
print("But before he could really give it second thought, he looked out the window, clsoing the door and he seen a shooting star.")

print("\(trainRide(train:.Adelaide) ?? "I'm a ganster") looked at the man, and yelled' Bye' as she darted off the train.")
print("The way she ran, you'd think she maybe thought the myth was real adn was going to go searching.")
print("As the ride continued, \(person1) Kept staring at \(person2) hoping he didn't catch him staring.")
print("Because of the timely stare off, \(person2) finally said something. ")
print("'you lookin for that money too old man, is that why you drive this train night after night. ")
print("\(person1) responded saying I know nothing about that man. I'm just driving this train.")
print("Meanwhile, \(trainRide(train:.Montacalm) ?? "Im a gangster") was sitting the corner back of the train, going back and forth with hisself about the story he heard at the stop before.")
print("As \(person1) was pulling up the next stop, Mack, he thought to himself I better take a break before I get to the end of my shift.")
print("He put the train in parked gear and exited the conductors door, while \(trainRide(train:.Montacalm) ?? "Im a gangster") sat in the corner still mumbling to himself.")
print("He gonna find that money, watch!! MHMMhmm, he gonna find it alright.")
print("The \(person2) exited as well, never saying a word.")
print("Out the corner of his eye, he could see \(person2)staring at  him.")
print("\(person1) quickly started walking towards the Coney Island, trying his hardest not to look back.")
print("He went inside the coney island, ordered his coffee, and went around back; he needed to pee.")
print("As he started peeing, the slender man in black came from around the front of the building and grabbed the \(person1) by the collar, threw him up against the wall and started punching him in the back.")
print("I know you know where the money is, you drive that train everynight and I know you seen where they threw the money.")
print("\(person1) angerily said, I have no idea what youre talking about; i just heard about this for the first time tonight.")
print("I normally ride the train uptown woodward.")

print("He wasn't dreaming at all.")
print("There was over five hundred thousand dollars in the bag.")
print("He thought quckly on his feet, stuffed as much as he could in his pants, jackets, even the socks.")

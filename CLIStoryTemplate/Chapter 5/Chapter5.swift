    print("\(person1) was a condutor on the Q-Line in the night time for the downtown Detroit Area.")
    print("Everyday until 6 am the next morning, he would ride up and down woodward; passing all the stops along the stetch gave him the oppurtunity to admire and dream.")
    print("It also was a time for him to see all the crazies and extras that come out in the night time. ")
    print("Even though the foolery, amzing things that couldn't be believed unless seen would happen.")
    print("See, \(person1) had a hard upbringing that didn't give him much time for dreaming.")
    print("He had to work several jobs to make ends meat.")
    print("When he did have time for dreaming, he dreamed of finding a lot of money that would take him on an adventure; maybe give him a new life.")
    print("But even though all he could do was dream, condutcing the train at night gave him that oppurtunity. ")
    print("Normally, Terri would  manage the train so that it would go uptown Woodward, instead, this night, he would travel Downtown. ")
    print("Because of that, he wasn't sure how the ride would go because he had never encoutered people from the downtown area, nor had he passed of any the stops going downtown.")
    print("There were always three stops he heard to be very aware at. They were Mack, Adelaide, and Montcalm.")
    print("He had heard so many stories about the wonders that happened in the night time in downtown area of woodward. ")
    print("All of which gave him the chills but he was looking forward to seeing the wonders of the night. ")
    print("As he clocked in for his shift, he statred up the engine and began his route on to downtown Woodward.")
    print("There were some funny charaters on his ride that night. ")
    print("He knew he would be able to stay awake and alert because he sat back and gave them all nicknames as they gave him the show of a lifetime. ")
    print("There was Quarter head Stan, Rena Red, and Two headed Sam because he had a knot the size of a small head on the side of his neck.")
    print(" \(trainRide(train:.Mack) ?? "I am gangster") needed to get off.")
    print("As he approached Mack, Quater head Stan seen a lady standing with a black bag  and a dog waiting to board the train.")
    print("He turned to Terri and asked him, just as the train was stopping, 'what would you do if you found a million dollars in a black bag?")
    print("Suddenly, the loud train got quiet and everyone got to thinking outloud.")
    print("One woman shouted, ' whoooooo, that would be some sweet cash right there as she slids hands with Quater head Stan.")
    print("Quater head Stan proceeds with his tale of how there is supposed to be a black bag with a blue handle filled with money.")
    print("According to him, the police was chasing a group of guys and at each stop they threw a bag filled with money; all except one was collected.")
    print("The train got queit and before you knew it, everyone on the train statrted laughing.")
    print("It's true' he yelled as he stomped off the train. ")
    print("Even though Terri laughed along with the crowd, he put serious thought into what he had just heard.")
    print("But before he could really give it second thought, he looked out the window, clsoing the door and he seen a shooting star.")
    print("The train quckly pulled off to the next stop.")
    print("Rena Red gets to singing her heart away.")
    print("Just before she could finsh her song, she looked directly at Terri and asked, ' hey, old man, you think that story he told us was true?'")
    print("Terri responded saying, Rena you got to stay away from them drugs girl. That man was telling us a fantasy.")
    print("Just as the train was pulling up the the next stop, Adelaide, A creepy looking slender man was  wearing all black stadning there waiting.")
    print("When the train stopped, the creepy slender man in all back got on, walked to the back adn stood holding on the handle for ceiling.")
    print("Rena looked at the man, and yelled' Bye' as she darted off the train.")
    print("The way she ran, you'd think she maybe thought the myth was real adn was going to go searching.")
    print("As the ride continued, Terri Kept staring at strange man until the strange man looked back at him.")
    print("Because of the timely stare off, the strange man finally said something. ")
    print("'you lookin for that money too old man, is that why you drive this train night after night. ")
    print("Terri responded saying I know nothing about that man. I'm just driving this train.")
    print("Meanwhile, Two head Sam was sitting the corner back of the train, going back and forth with hisself about the story he heard at the stop before.")
    print("As terri was pulling up the next stop, Mack, he thought to himself I better take a break before I get to the end of my shift.")
    print("He put the train in parked gear and exited the conductors door, while Two head Sam sat in the corner still mumbling to himself.")
    print("he gonna find that money, watch!! MHMMhmm, he gonna find it alright.")
    print("The slender man in Black exited as well, never saying a word.")
    print("Out the corner of his eye, he could see the slender man staring him.")
    print("Terri quickly started walking towards the Coney Island, trying his hardest not to look back.")
    print("He went inside the coney island, ordered his coffee, and went around back; he needed to pee.")
    print("As he started peeing, the slender man in black came from around the front of the building and grabbed the Terri by the collar, threw him up against the wall and started punching him in the back.")
    print("I know you know where the money is, you drive that train everynight and I know you seen where they threw the money.")
    print("Terri angerily said, I have no idea what youre talking about; i just heard about this for the first time tonight.")
    print("I normally ride the train uptown woodward.")
    print("The slender man in Black let him go and scurried off, leaving Terri bent over trying to catch his breathe.")
    print("Just as he stood up to turn around to walk back to the train, he seen a hundred dollar bill befind thr trash can sticking out.")
    print("Terri walked to loook behind the dumpster only to see the black bag, opened up with hundreds falling out of the bag.")
    print("He rubbed his eyes, he knew he had to be dreaming, but he wasn't")
    print("He wasn't dreaming at all.")
    print("There was over five hundred thousand dollars in the bag.")
    print("He thought quckly on his feet, stuffed as much as he could in his pants, jackets, even the socks.")
    print("He walked quickly back to train saying nothing and keeping his head down.")
    print("As he was getting back on the train, he looked up to see Two head Sam still sitting in the corner mumbling to himself.")
